   <h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br>
   It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,<br>
   supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br>
   <img src="JavaScript.jpg" width="100%">
   It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
   The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.<br>
   In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/o<br>
   JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.<br>
   The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,<br>
   the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p></body>
